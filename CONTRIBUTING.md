**READ CODE OF CONDUCT**
Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/clubgamma/code-of-conduct) before starting contributing.

#### Coding conventions to be followed -

1. Maintain a proper project folder structure
2. Follow proper naming conventions
3. Read the instructions - [Hacktober fest 2022](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/)

### Getting Started

1.  If you are new to Git and GitHub, it is advisable that you go through
    [GitHub For Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)
    **before** moving to ahead.
2.  Pick any issue you want to work on from the [issues](https://github.com/clubgamma/task-tacker/issues), discuss with maintainer on issue and then start.

3.  Fork the project on GitHub.
    [Help Guide to Fork a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo/).
    ![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58077762/93772626-ac77ef80-fc3c-11ea-8ee6-e381e1d68280.png)
    After a sucessful fork, you'll see a copy of this repo in your own account.

4.  Clone the project.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/clubgamma/task-tracker
    ```

    [Help Guide to Clone a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)

5.  Create a branch specific to the issue you are working on.

    ```shell
    git checkout -b branch-name
    ```

    (Take inspiration for branch name from the issue you are working on!)

6.  Open up the project in your favorite text editor.

    Select the file you want to contribute to, and make your changes.

    If you are making changes to the `README.md` file, you would need to have
    Markdown knowledge. Visit
    [here to read about GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    and
    [here to practice](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

7.  Add your modified
    files to git, [How to Add, Commit, Push, and Go](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/).

    You can also add all unstaged files using:

    ```shell
    git add .
    ```

    **Note:** using a `git add .` will automatically add all files. You can do a
    `git status` to see your changes, but do it **before** `git add`.

8.  Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

    ```shell
    git commit -m "Brief Description of Commit"
    ```

9.  Push your commits to your GitHub Fork:

    ```shell
    git push -u origin branch-name
    ```

10. Submit a pull request.
